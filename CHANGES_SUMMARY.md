# Render Deployment - Changes Summary

## ✅ All Changes Implemented for Render Deployment

This document summarizes all changes made to enable seamless Render deployment for your poker server.

---

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `server/package.json`
**Added Node engine specification:**
```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=16.0.0",
  "npm": ">=8.0.0"
}
```
**Why:** Render needs to know which Node version to use for building and running your app.

---

### 2. `src/hooks/usePokerSocket.ts`
**Updated socket URL configuration:**
```typescript
// Before:
const SOCKET_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'

// After:
const SOCKET_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_POKER_SERVER_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'
```
**Why:** Now supports environment variables for production deployment while maintaining localhost fallback for development.

---

### 3. `src/hooks/useBSPokerSocket.ts`
**Updated socket URL configuration:**
```typescript
// Before:
const SOCKET_URL = 'http://localhost:3001'

// After:
const SOCKET_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_POKER_SERVER_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'
```
**Why:** Same as above - enables production deployment with environment variables.
